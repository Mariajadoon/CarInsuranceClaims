# Car Insurance Claims
Operating a vehicle requires having car insurance. This study utilizes annual data provided by a car insurance company, aiming to predict the likelihood of customers filing car insurance claims. The prediction is based on various factors such as the customerâ€™s driving experience, education, income, credit score, vehicle ownership, vehicle year, age, and more. Employing Artificial Intelligence enables the anticipation of customers likely to make insurance claims, offering valuable insights for insurance companies to understand and manage customer behavior. This project focuses on implementing a neural network model to predict which customers are prone to making car insurance claims.

This project is divided into four phases:
1) Data analysis & preparation
2) Build a model to overfit the entire dataset
3) Model selection & evaluation
4) Feature importance and reduction

The final report in a PDF format is included which provides a deep dive into each phase of the project.
